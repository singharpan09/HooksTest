`Functional Component do not have State`

`Hooks is a new feature that allow to use State without using Class based Component`

`till now we were thinking State as an javaScript object`

`React Hooks changed the Concept of state as javacript object`

`Now,in React Hooks...state can be anything...Array,Object,string,number,boolean....`

`We can have Multiples state in React Hooks`

`const [a,b]=[1,2]..here "a" will be "1" & "b" will be "2"...this is destructuring`

`useEffect Hooks is mixer of ComponentDidMount and ComponentDidUpdate`

`useEffect method invokes itself like "ComponentDidMount" and called Everytime whenever any state change like "ComponentDidUpdate"`
